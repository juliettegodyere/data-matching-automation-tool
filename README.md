# data-matching-automation-tool
This is a Data Matching Automation tool for an health insurance company. The aim is to enhance their claims processing. Built with Springboot, MySQL and Thymeleaf.

 I want to build an enterprise application for a health insurance firm.  The have an existing database that contains all their services and their codes. When a provider sends their claims in an excel sheet, they want to upload it into the system, the application is expected to match the uploaded data against the existing data in the database and present the result to them to manually authorize matches that are not 100% match. The application will have features like upload CSV, download processed data in CSV, filter, auto and manually athorize matches. Reject matches. Help me plan out this application using springboot and thymeleaf.

Building an enterprise application like the one you described using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf is a great idea. Here's a step-by-step plan to help you get started:

1. Project Setup:

Set up a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE or the Spring Initializr.
Include necessary dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf, H2 Database (for development/testing), Apache POI (for Excel handling).
2. Database Configuration:

Configure your Spring Boot application to connect to the existing database.
Use Spring Data JPA to create entities and repositories for the existing data.
3. Upload CSV:

Create an upload page using Thymeleaf to allow users to upload Excel sheets.
Use Apache POI to parse the uploaded Excel sheet and extract the data.
4. Data Matching:

Implement a service that matches the uploaded data against the existing data in the database.
Use your matching logic to identify potential matches.
Store the results in the database or in-memory data structures.
5. Display Matches:

Create a Thymeleaf template to display the matched data to the user.
Allow users to manually authorize or reject the matches that are not 100% accurate.
6. Filter and Search:

Implement filtering and search options to help users find specific matches.
You can use Spring Data JPA's query methods to perform filtered searches.
7. Authorization and Rejection:

Implement functionality to allow users to manually authorize or reject matches.
Update the database accordingly based on user actions.
8. Download Processed Data:

Provide an option for users to download the processed data in CSV format.
Generate a CSV file based on the authorized matches.
9. UI Enhancements:

Design the Thymeleaf templates to be user-friendly and responsive.
Use Thymeleaf expressions to dynamically populate data in the templates.
10. Testing:

Write unit tests and integration tests for your services and components.
Test various scenarios, including data matching, authorization, and rejection.
11. Security:

Implement Spring Security to ensure secure access to the application.
Configure user roles and permissions as needed.
12. Deployment:

Deploy the application to a production environment.
Use a proper database (other than H2) for production usage. I am going to use Progresql as the DB. I will deploy the code the heroku using the video example here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHL0iZbil-o

13. Documentation:

Create documentation for how to use the application, including user guides and developer documentation.
14. Continuous Improvement:

=== Outstanding ===
1. Testing
2. Security
3. Deployment
4. Documentation

Gather user feedback and make improvements to the application based on user needs.
Remember that building an enterprise application involves various aspects, such as architecture, security, performance optimization, and user experience. It's essential to plan your application architecture well and follow best practices to ensure a robust and efficient system. Additionally, consider using version control (e.g., Git) and setting up a CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.
